# Roles

The realization of the IDS Certification schema requires different roles responsible for different tasks:
* Applicants,
* Evaluation Facilities, and
* one Certification Body

It should be noted that all roles described in this section are specific to the International Data Spaces (i.e. terms such as "Certification Body" should not be misunderstood to refer to an existing organization already granting certificates).

The defined roles and their main tasks are described below, while additional details on their tasks and interactions are described in [Section 4.2.5](./4_2_5_Processes.md).

## Certification Body

The Certification Body oversees the certification process regarding quality assurance and framework governance. It defines standard evaluation procedures and supervises the actions of the Evaluation Facilities. A certificate is granted only if both the Evaluation Facility and the Certification Body have come to the conclusion that all preconditions for certification are fulfilled.

## Evaluation Facility

Contracted by an Applicant (see below), the Evaluation Facility is responsible for carrying out the detailed technical and/or organizational evaluation work during a certification process. The Evaluation Facility issues an evaluation report for the respective organization/individual or core component, listing details regarding the evaluation process and an assessment whether all requirements are properly fulfilled.

The term "Evaluation Facility" refers both to authorized auditors for management system evaluations (i.e., for Operational Environment Certification) as well as approved evaluators for software stacks (i.e., for Component Certification). Hence, the Certification Body oversees and cooperates with multiple Evaluation Facilities. However, only one Evaluation Facility is involved in each evaluation of an organization/individual or core component.

## Applicant

The Applicant is not just the subject of the evaluation and certification process, but plays an active part in it.
An Applicant needs to actively submit an application to an Evaluation Facility to trigger the certification process for any component intended to get certified with a higher trust level than 1.
This applies to organizations/individuals that develop software components intended to be deployed within the International Data Spaces (i.e., prospective Software Providers) and to organizations that intend to operate components in the IDS.
During the certification process, the Applicant provides all necessary material needed for the evaluation and certification of its component or organization and supports with questions or issues arising.
The Applicant can choose the Evaluation Facility upon his demands. The certification process will be then organized mainly by the chosen Evaluation Facility whereas the Certification Body will be informed only of the process started by the Evaluation Facility. 
If the component or operational environment is meant to be certified for trust level 1, the applicant can chosse the "self-assessment" approach, where NO Evaluation Facility is required.
Here, the applicant needs to visit the IDSA Website (Link Here) to registeres to the "IDS Certification Portal" for triggering the start of the certification for IDS components with the trust level 1. By filling out a questionnaire with true/false and open questions the applicant assures the IDS conformity of the component. Here, the IDS Certification Body is responsible for checking and assessing the answers given by the applicant. In case of a positive outcome, the Certification Body provides the certificate directly to the applicant.
